## üîç About
Bittered Sling is a webpage completely designed and coded by me as the one-week final project for the Web Development Course of jediUPC. The main idea of Bittered Sling is to serve as an API client from TheCocktailDB and be used as a browser for cocktails and drink recipes.

## üß± Assets
  * This webpage has been created using base HTML5, CSS3 and JS. 
  * JQuery was also used for the DOM tasks.
  * To fetch the data from the API we were required to use the Axios HTTP client.
  * For the web design, besides some custom CSS, [Font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used for the icons and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for some utilities.
  
  * For the curved shape dividers, I used [this tool](https://www.shapedivider.app/).

## ‚≠ê Key Features
Based on the project requirements, the following features can be found while using the web app.

  * User authentication. Without encryption or security mechanisms, it provides a simple user creation and authentication workaround using a `JSON server` hosted on [Railway](https://railway.app/).

  >Login feature not available on the preview version of the website.

  * For session management it uses the browser's `local storage`.

  * It includes error management and provides warnings and notifications for all the session status for a better user experience.

  * `Bootstrap breakpoints` and `media queries` allow the website to be displayed and fully functional on all screen sizes. Despite its `responsiveness`, it's meant to be mainly used on a desktop support.

  * On the `search` tab, the dice feature allows you to be presented with a selection of 4 random drinks.

  * The normal search feature can also be used, and it works following a hierarchy model when creating an entry. You can search following this criteria:
      1. First drink letter
      2. Ingredient
      3. Category
      4. Drink name
      5. Alcohol type
      6. Glass type
   
  The information displayed when selecting a drink is: the preparation steps, ingredients, quantities and tasks and categories.
